# 🚀 Algorithm Challenge #10 - Average of 3 Marks

### 🧠 Problem Description
Create a C++ program that asks the user to **enter three marks**, then calculates and displays their **average**.

---

### 💡 What It Covers
- Arithmetic operations and **operator precedence**
- Using **parentheses** for correct evaluation
- **Float division** vs **integer division**
- Clean and clear console output

---

### 🧾 Example Output
Please enter 3 marks separated by spaces: 80 90 70

Calculation: (80 + 90 + 70) / 3 = 80
Average Mark: 80

🧠 Explanation
The program asks the user to enter three marks.
The marks are read and stored in mark1, mark2, and mark3.
The program uses parentheses to ensure correct order of operations.
Dividing by 3.0 ensures the result is a floating-point average, not an integer.
The final average is displayed neatly with clear labels.

| Concept               | Description                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Arithmetic Operations | Using `+` and `/` correctly       |
| Operator Precedence   | Importance of parentheses         |
| Float Division        | Using `3.0` for precise results   |
| Input/Output          | Clean and readable console output |
